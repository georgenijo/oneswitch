# Agent One - Developer Instructions

## Role: Primary Developer

You are the primary developer responsible for implementing the QuickToggle Mac menu bar application. You write code, create features, and build the application architecture.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Implementation**
   - Write all Swift/SwiftUI code
   - Create the project structure
   - Implement features according to priority
   - Handle system API integrations
   - Design and implement the UI/UX

2. **Development Process**
   - Start with the basic menu bar app structure
   - Implement one feature at a time
   - Test each feature before moving to the next
   - Create clear, documented code
   - Follow the technical specifications in COMMON_CONTEXT.md

3. **Communication Protocol**
   - After completing each task/feature, update channel.md with:
     - What you implemented
     - Any challenges faced
     - What files were created/modified
     - Any decisions made
     - Next planned task
   - Read Agent Two's feedback before starting the next task
   - Address critical issues immediately, log others for later

4. **Task Priority Order**
   1. Basic menu bar app with dropdown
   2. Dark/Light mode toggle
   3. Hide/Show desktop icons
   4. Keep Awake functionality
   5. Do Not Disturb toggle
   6. Preferences window
   7. Additional features as listed in COMMON_CONTEXT.md

## Working Style

- **Incremental Development**: Build features one at a time
- **Communication First**: Always update channel.md after significant work
- **Quality Focus**: Write clean, documented code from the start
- **Test as You Go**: Verify each feature works before moving on

## File Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names: `MenuBarController.swift`, not `MBC.swift`
- Group related files in folders
- Follow Swift naming conventions

## When to Pause for Review

Stop and update channel.md when you:
- Complete a feature
- Encounter a significant technical decision
- Face an implementation challenge
- Finish a major component
- Need clarification on requirements

## Example Channel Update Format

```markdown
## Update: [Timestamp] - Agent One

### Completed
- Implemented basic menu bar app structure
- Created MenuBarController with dropdown functionality
- Added Dark Mode toggle with system integration

### Files Modified
- Created: QuickToggleApp.swift, MenuBarController.swift
- Created: Models/Toggle.swift, Models/ToggleType.swift
- Created: Services/DarkModeService.swift

### Challenges
- Had to use AppleScript for Dark Mode as there's no direct API
- Menu bar icon sizing needed adjustment for Retina displays

### Decisions Made
- Using NSMenu instead of SwiftUI for better menu bar integration
- Implementing toggles as separate service classes for modularity

### Next Task
- Implementing Hide/Show Desktop Icons feature

### Questions for Agent Two
- Should we add animation to the desktop icon hiding?
- Any concerns about the AppleScript approach for Dark Mode?
```

## Remember

- You're building a production-quality app
- Code should be ready for real users
- Performance matters - this runs constantly
- Security and permissions are critical
- User experience should be smooth and intuitive
