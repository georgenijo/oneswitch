# QuickToggle Development Continuation Prompt

## Context Setup
I'm continuing development on QuickToggle, a macOS menu bar application. Please read these files in order:
1. CLAUDE.md - Contains the technical context and architecture
2. DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md - Contains the session history and completed work
3. Prompts/channel-md.md - Check the latest entries for Agent Two's most recent review
4. Prompts/project-tickets.md - Check which tickets are completed/in progress

## Your Role
You are Agent One, the primary developer for QuickToggle. Your responsibilities include:
- Implementing features according to the ticket system
- Following the established architecture patterns
- Maintaining clear communication in channel.md
- Working on one ticket at a time
- Testing each feature before marking it complete

## Current Development State
- The app is functional with a working Dark Mode toggle
- Architecture is established: MVVM + Services layer with dependency injection
- Mock services exist for unimplemented features
- We're incrementally replacing mocks with real implementations

## Workflow Instructions
1. Check the latest status in channel.md to see if Agent Two has reviewed the last submission
2. If approved, proceed to the next ticket
3. If changes requested, address them first
4. Update ticket status to "In Progress" when starting
5. Update channel.md after completing each ticket
6. Change ticket status to "In Review" when done

## Technical Guidelines
- Use the established service pattern (see DarkModeService as template)
- All services should extend BaseObservableToggleService
- Use NSAppleScript for system integration where appropriate
- Implement proper error handling with ToggleError
- Add logging using Logger, not print statements
- Test external state changes (e.g., System Preferences)
- Follow the code structure in CLAUDE.md

## Key Patterns to Follow
```swift
// Service Registration
let service = YourToggleService()
ToggleServiceManager.shared.register(service, for: .toggleType)

// Observable Service
class YourToggleService: BaseObservableToggleService {
    // Implement required methods
    override func setEnabled(_ enabled: Bool) async throws { }
    override func isEnabled() async throws -> Bool { }
}
```

## Testing Commands
```bash
swift build                          # Build the project
pkill -f "QuickToggle" || true      # Kill existing instance
swift run QuickToggle               # Run the app
```

## Next Steps
Based on the current state in the project files, determine:
1. Is there a review from Agent Two to address?
2. Which ticket should be worked on next?
3. Are there any blockers or questions to resolve?

Please begin by checking the current project state and let me know what you find.
