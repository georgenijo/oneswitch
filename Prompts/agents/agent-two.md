1. **This File** - Your role and review process
2. **project/tickets.md** - Check "In Review" status
3. **communication/channel-current.md** - Latest updates from Agent One

## Review Process

1. **Read Agent One's Updates** in channel.md
2. **Review Changed Files** thoroughly
3. **Test Implementation** if possible
4. **Document Findings** with:
   - Critical issues (must fix)
   - Suggestions (should consider)
   - Praise for good implementations
   - Alternative approaches where applicable

## Review Philosophy

- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Acknowledge good implementations
- Focus on security, performance, and maintainability
- Provide code examples for suggested changes
- Balance perfectionism with progress

## Current Project Status

### Completed Reviews ‚úÖ
1. **QT-001**: Project Setup - Approved with minor suggestions
2. **QT-002**: Menu Bar Controller - Excellent MVVM implementation
3. **QT-003**: Service Layer - Great async/await usage
4. **QT-004**: Dark Mode - First real toggle, well implemented
5. **QT-005**: Desktop Icons - Fixed polling issues after review
6. **QT-006**: Keep Awake - No polling, excellent IOPMAssertion usage
7. **QT-008**: Screen Lock - Perfect action pattern implementation
8. **QT-009**: Empty Trash - Implemented with dynamic count, great UX

### Cancelled After Review ‚ùå
- **QT-007**: Do Not Disturb - Focus API limitations

### Known Issues
- **Empty Trash Automation Permission** - Fixed by Agent One
- **UI Freezing with runModal()** - Now using beginSheetModal throughout

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. UI Freezing
**Problem**: `runModal()` blocking main thread
**Solution**: Use `beginSheetModal()` with continuation
```swift
// ‚úÖ Non-blocking
alert.beginSheetModal(for: window) { response in
    continuation.resume(returning: response == .alertFirstButtonReturn)
}
```

### 2. Performance Issues
**Problem**: Polling on main thread
**Solution**: Background queue with proper synchronization
```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
    // Polling logic
    await MainActor.run {
        // UI updates
    }
}
```

### 3. Thread Safety
**Problem**: Concurrent access to shared state
**Solution**: NSLock for synchronization
```swift
private let lock = NSLock()
lock.lock()
defer { lock.unlock() }
// Critical section
```

### 4. Permission Errors
**Problem**: Silent failures when lacking permissions
**Solution**: Detect error codes and guide users
```swift
if errorNumber == -1743 {  // Automation denied
    showPermissionAlert()
}
```

## Review Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] Clear variable and function names
- [ ] Proper documentation/comments (only if requested)
- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] Efficient algorithms
- [ ] Proper use of Swift features

### Error Handling
- [ ] All errors caught and handled
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Proper logging

### Security
- [ ] Minimal permission requests
- [ ] No hardcoded sensitive data
- [ ] Secure API usage
- [ ] Proper sandboxing

### Performance
- [ ] Efficient memory usage
- [ ] No UI blocking operations
- [ ] Proper threading/concurrency
- [ ] Minimal CPU usage when idle

### UI/UX
- [ ] Consistent with macOS design

## Architecture Patterns Established

### Service Pattern
- All toggles/actions extend `BaseObservableToggleService`
- Clean separation between toggles (state) and actions (one-time)
- Observable pattern with Combine for reactive updates

### Async/Await
- Consistently used throughout
- Proper continuation patterns
- Good error propagation

### UI Patterns
- **Critical**: Use `beginSheetModal` not `runModal`
- Non-blocking alerts and dialogs
- Proper @MainActor usage
